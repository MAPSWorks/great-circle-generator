## Great Circle Generator

This C++ program generates "great circles" on a globe, calculates their intersections, and outputs all of the data to a JavaScript that can be embedded directly into a page for visualization.

The HTML, CSS and JavaScript files in this repo use the generated JavaScript to visualize the great circles with a d3.js globe.

`circles.js` is a pre-calculated output of the main program.

Use `./main > circles.js` after compiling main to overwrite this file with fresh circles.
